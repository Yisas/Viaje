This is a personal project developped in my spare time both for fun and as a learning experience. It's the first video game project I created as the sole programmer. The 2D art assets were provided by Isabella Rubial, and the animations where done by myself. The game features my oldest friends as playable characters, using the gameplay as ways to sublty (and not so subtly) poke fun at them. The game takes place across landmarks from my hometown, as well as my childhood house. Some of the jokes are R-rated and immature. The songs and photoshopped pictures, perhaps the biggest source of tackiness involved, were actually created by my friends, though not for the purpose of being used as assets for a video game. You probably shouldn't play it, but if you really want to, you can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/Yisas/Viaje/releases/download/v1.0/Viaje.rar). It was developped in Spanish since that's our native language. Both of the developper's likenesses are featured in the loading screen. I'm the one flapping about in the chicken suit, because hey, why not.
